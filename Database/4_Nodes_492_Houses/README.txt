NOTE:  These files have only been tested with version 3.2.  A revision may be posted once the generator_controller object is updated.

These files represent a simple example using the generator_controller bidding
object attached to a very simple 4-node system.  The generator_controller emulates
a distributed-energy-resource (DER) generator bidding into the local market to decide
when to activate or not.  The control mechanism implemented is that given in the following
publications:

D. J. Hammerstrom, et al., "Pacific Northwest GridWise Testbed Demonstration Projects, Part I: Olympic Peninsula Project",
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Technical Report, PNNL-17167, Richland, WA, October 2007
